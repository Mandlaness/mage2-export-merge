GLK-G17,,Firearms,simple,"Shooting Stuff/Guns and Ammo,Shooting Stuff/Guns and Ammo/Handguns/Pistols,Shooting Stuff/Guns and Ammo/Handguns/Pistols/Glock,Shooting Stuff/Guns and Ammo/Handguns",shs,Glock G17 Gen 3 9x19 Standard Pistol,"<p>The Glock G17 Gen 3 9x19 Standard Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition. This third generation handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters!

This third generation handgun holds 15 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>
<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</li></ol>
<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>
<p>Compact models are most versatile, offering a great balance between open carry, concealed carry and range use. The integrated mounting rail allows quick and convenient mounting / dismounting of accessories like tactical torches and lasers.</p>","The Glock G19 Gen 3 9x19 Compact Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition.

<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>
<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</li></ol>
<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>
<p>Compact models are most versatile, offering a great balance between open carry, concealed carry and range use. The integrated mounting rail allows quick and convenient mounting / dismounting of accessories like tactical torches and lasers.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<ul><li>1x Pistol

GLK-G27-4,shs_en,Firearms,simple,,,,"<p>The Glock G27 Gen 4 .40 S&W; Sub-Compact Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 40 S&W; calibre ammunition. This fourth generation handgun holds 9 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>
<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</li></ol>
<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>

This third generation handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available. This model is designed specifically to comply with IPSC Standard Gun size limitations.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>

<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>

This fourth generation handgun holds 13 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available. This model is designed specifically to comply with IPSC Standard Gun size limitations. The MOS-models are designed to accept ruggedised Miniature Optical Sights, mounted to the slide.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>
<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</li></ol>
<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>
<p>The extended barrel length and longer sight radius of the competition models offer greater precision to competitive shooters and special units.</p>","The Glock G41 Gen 4 MOS .45 ACP Competition Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 45 Auto (ACP) calibre ammunition.

It is chambered for 12 Gauge Shotgun calibre ammunition. This shotgun holds 4 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazine extensions are available (typically up to 9 + 1, or more on request).</p><p>The Beretta 1301 Comp is ideal for 3-Gun action events, since it handles like a dream and has oversized controls. The cocking handle, bolt-release lever as well as the loading and ejection ports are oversized for simple and intuitive use under the heat of competition. </p><p>The 1301 Comp reliably feeds popular loads and will always perform like a Beretta!</p><p>The short, black-synthetic, tactical stock has aggressive, non-slip checkering for reliable handling, even under the stress of competition. The length of pull is adjustable.</p><p>The 1301 features Beretta's ""Blink"" gas operating system, making it one of the fastest cycling semi-auto shotguns on the market. Strong, yet light and compact, the vertical distance between your dominant eye and your supporting hand is minimised, thus increasing the chance of hitting the target. The top of the receiver is already drilled and tapped for rail mounts, so it is easy to mount the optics of your choice; no gunsmithing required!</p><p>The 24"" barrel is made of Steelium, Beretta's own steel blend, and incorporates OptimaBore HP interchangeable chokes. The barrel features a wide, stepped, sporting rib with both a mid-bead and front fibre-optic sight for fast, instinctive shooting. </p><p>For those pushing their equipment to the extreme, the loading port on the Beretta 1301 Comp can be easily enlarged since the internal mechanisms are minimised, and kept to just the right side of the gun (in that area). Shooting Stuff has developed a range of magazine extension tubes for the Beretta 1301 Comp. The modular Super-Lite offer superior versatility, while the full-length Simplex Extension Tube is most popular!</p>","The Beretta 1301 Comp 12ga Semi-Auto 24"" Shotgun is a competition-ready semi-auto shotgun, designed to win right out of the box.

U.S. Carbine, Caliber .30 M1) is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic rifle, originally chambered for the .30 Carbine cartridge. It became a standard _rearm for the American military during World War II, the Korean War and the early stages of the Vietnam War, and was widely used by USA and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces. In the post-war era it has also been a popular civilian _rearm for recreational use and collecting. Over 6.5-million M1 carbines of various models and variants were manufactured. Despite being designed by Winchester, most of these were made by other companies. The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but the M1 Carbine was also made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company.</p><p>The Chiappa Firearmsí M1-series is a fine, modern replica of the M1 Carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight.

Components are CNC-machined and are interchangeable with original M1 Carbine parts. </p><p>The M1-standard metal rear sight, adjustable in elevation and windage, can be removed to fit optical or electro-optical sights.

This handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p><p>The venerable M1 Carbine (a.k.a. U.S. Carbine, Caliber .30 M1) is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic rifle, originally chambered for the .30 Carbine cartridge. It became a standard _rearm for the American military during World War II, the Korean War and the early stages of the Vietnam War, and was widely used by USA and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces. In the post-war era it has also been a popular civilian _rearm for recreational use and collecting. Over 6.5-million M1 carbines of various models and variants were manufactured. Despite being designed by Winchester, most of these were made by other companies. The largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but the M1 Carbine was also made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company.</p><p>The Chiappa Firearmsí M1-series is a fine, modern replica of the M1 Carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight. The M1 is available as the M1-9 in 9mm Luger, or as the M1-22 in .22 LR. Components are CNC-machined and are interchangeable with original M1 Carbine parts. </p><p>The M1-standard metal rear sight, adjustable in elevation and windage, can be removed to fit optical or electro-optical sights. The M1-standard metal front sight is fixed.</p><p>The bolt and the 18"" barrel are made of matte, blued steel. The trigger guard and magazine guide are polymer. </p><p>A wooden stock version and a black synthetic stock version are available. </p><p>The magazine is compatible with the Beretta 92 pistol.</p><p>The rifle incorporates a standard M1 trigger block (safety catch).</p><p>This M1-9 semi-auto rifle has a black synthetic stock, and is chambered in 9mm Luger.</p>","The Chiappa M1 Synthetic 9x19 Semi-Auto 18"" Rifle is a proven firearm with a traditional steel frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition.

This handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the extended magazines specifically designed for the IPSC Standard Gun division.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Infinity Fireams, based in Texas USA, builds the world's finest pistols based on the proven 1911-style platform. Every pistol is built to a customer's specific functional and cosmetic requirements, following design on Infinity's on-line Gunbuilder program. Shooting Stuff is available to help customers design their own Infinity, guiding them through the on-line process or by offering pistols ex-stock.</p>
<p class=""p2"">To ensure quality and strength, all parts are made in-house from billet barstock, and each pistol is hand-fit and finished with an extreme level of attention to detail - the slide cycles super-smoothly and the trigger is astounding - crisp and clean! Infinity's innovations are tried and tested by Team Infinity, over 40 of the top competitive shooters worldwide. All this ensures perfect reliability out of the box!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Some of the incredible Infinity innovations we've designed into our stock pistols, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity mastered the metal grip to offer a wide selection of diameters, textures, lengths and trigger guard profiles that enable a near-perfect ergonomic fit to each shooter's hand. </li>
<li>Infinity developed Accuracy Enhancing Technology (AET) that allows their firearms to deliver superb accuracy. Titanium Nitride (TiN) coated barrels feature gain twist rifling and the Sight Tracker adds an unported, hybrid-rib to the barrel where the front sight is mounted. In this way the front sight does not cycle back to front with the slide, it just moves up and down under recoil making it easier to track under recoil.</li>
<li>The Tri-Glide trigger system reduces contact points and friction, leading to the most sought-after trigger system for 1911 pistols! The interchangeable trigger inserts allow the trigger reach to be adjusted, as well as the ""feel"" - curved, flat and combinations are available.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2"">Due to incredible international popularity of these fine pistols, Infinity Firearms has a production lead-time of 12 to 15 months. Shooting Stuff, the South African distributor for Infinity Firearms, has regular pre-booked slots to reduce this lead-time and offers several popular pistol designs ex-stock. By stocking spare parts, magazines, etc. and by using these fine firearms ourselves, Shooting Stuff with Infinity Firearms are able to support Infinity owners into the future, and beyond!</p>
<p class=""p1"">This Standard Gun is built on the Infinity Extended Dust-cover (IED) and features Infinity's Sight Tracker technology, with a serrated, steel front sight fitted to the ribbed barrel. The red Skater-Terrain grip tape fits snugly into the CNC-machined aluminium billet grip, yet is easily changed to give the pistol a fresh look!</p>","The Infinity Firearms IED Sight Tracker .40 S&W Semi-Auto 5.4""Competition Pistol is a custom-built, high-capacity, 1911-style pistol, chambered for 40 S&W calibre ammunition.

SVI-GB50954,shs_en,Firearms,simple,,,,"<p>The Infinity Firearms IED Sight Tracker .40 S&W; Semi-Auto 5.4""Competition Pistol is a custom-built, high-capacity, 1911-style pistol, chambered for 40 S&W; calibre ammunition. This handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the extended magazines specifically designed for the IPSC Standard Gun division.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Infinity Fireams, based in Texas USA, builds the world's finest pistols based on the proven 1911-style platform. Every pistol is built to a customer's specific functional and cosmetic requirements, following design on Infinity's on-line Gunbuilder program. Shooting Stuff is available to help customers design their own Infinity, guiding them through the on-line process or by offering pistols ex-stock.</p>
<p class=""p2"">To ensure quality and strength, all parts are made in-house from billet barstock, and each pistol is hand-fit and finished with an extreme level of attention to detail - the slide cycles super-smoothly and the trigger is astounding - crisp and clean! Infinity's innovations are tried and tested by Team Infinity, over 40 of the top competitive shooters worldwide. All this ensures perfect reliability out of the box!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Some of the incredible Infinity innovations we've designed into our stock pistols, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinity mastered the metal grip to offer a wide selection of diameters, textures, lengths and trigger guard profiles that enable a near-perfect ergonomic fit to each shooter's hand. </li>
<li>Infinity developed Accuracy Enhancing Technology (AET) that allows their firearms to deliver superb accuracy. Titanium Nitride (TiN) coated barrels feature gain twist rifling and the Sight Tracker adds an unported, hybrid-rib to the barrel where the front sight is mounted. In this way the front sight does not cycle back to front with the slide, it just moves up and down under recoil making it easier to track under recoil.</li>
<li>The Tri-Glide trigger system reduces contact points and friction, leading to the most sought-after trigger system for 1911 pistols! The interchangeable trigger inserts allow the trigger reach to be adjusted, as well as the ""feel"" - curved, flat and combinations are available.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p2"">Due to incredible international popularity of these fine pistols, Infinity Firearms has a production lead-time of 12 to 15 months. Shooting Stuff, the South African distributor for Infinity Firearms, has regular pre-booked slots to reduce this lead-time and offers several popular pistol designs ex-stock. By stocking spare parts, magazines, etc. and by using these fine firearms ourselves, Shooting Stuff with Infinity Firearms are able to support Infinity owners into the future, and beyond!</p>
<p class=""p1"">This Standard Gun is built on the Infinity Extended Dust-cover (IED) and features Infinity's Sight Tracker technology, with a serrated, steel front sight fitted to the ribbed barrel. The red Skater-Terrain grip tape fits snugly into the CNC-machined aluminium billet grip, yet is easily changed to give the pistol a fresh look!</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Block after Info Column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fourth generation handgun holds 15 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available. The MOS-models are designed to accept ruggedised Miniature Optical Sights, mounted to the slide.</p>
<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>
<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>
<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>
<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>
<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>
<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</li></ol>
<li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</li>
<li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li>
<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>
<p>Compact models are most versatile, offering a great balance between open carry, concealed carry and range use. The integrated mounting rail allows quick and convenient mounting / dismounting of accessories like tactical torches and lasers.</p>","The Glock G19 Gen 4 MOS 9x19 Compact Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition.

<p>CZ designers set out to improve the CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow in terms of speed, accuracy and durability. The CZ Shadow 2 was the result - an affordable sport pistol that is perfectly suited for IPSC Production Division. </p>
<p>Speed improvement was addressed by modernising principal parts of the pistol. The CZ Shadow 2 frame design improved the alignment between the shooter's hand and the barrel axis, to reduce the perceived recoil. The heavier frame and increased weight in the front part of the slide reduce the recoil. The cocking grooves in the front and rear of the slide, and the checkering on the frame and anodized Aluminium grips enhance the contact between gun and hand. The CZ Shadow 2 has a very smooth trigger action and a shortened trigger reset. These aspects all contribute to increased shooting speed.</p>
<p>The extended 125 mm barrel and the new longer height-adjustble sights contribute to the improved accuracy of the CZ Shadow 2.</p>
<p>The CZ Shadow 2 has an Arcor finish for high wear and corrosion resistance, making it extremely durable.</p>

This handgun holds 18 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>
<p>CZ designers set out to improve the CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow in terms of speed, accuracy and durability. The CZ Shadow 2 was the result - an affordable sport pistol that is perfectly suited for IPSC Production Division. </p>
<p>Speed improvement was addressed by modernising principal parts of the pistol. The CZ Shadow 2 frame design improved the alignment between the shooter's hand and the barrel axis, to reduce the perceived recoil. The heavier frame and increased weight in the front part of the slide reduce the recoil. The cocking grooves in the front and rear of the slide, and the checkering on the frame and anodized Aluminium grips enhance the contact between gun and hand. The CZ Shadow 2 has a very smooth trigger action and a shortened trigger reset. These aspects all contribute to increased shooting speed.</p>
<p>The extended 125 mm barrel and the new longer height-adjustble sights contribute to the improved accuracy of the CZ Shadow 2.</p>
<p>The CZ Shadow 2 has an Arcor finish for high wear and corrosion resistance, making it extremely durable.</p>

The sizing die is fitted with a ring of Titanium Carbide, the ideal material for resizing cartridge cases.

Titanium Carbide has the highest hardness of any readily available carbide, and has a slippery non-galling surface that is ideal for resizing of cartridge cases without requiring lubricant. While not required, we still recommend using an easy-to-apply case lubricant like Dillon DCL, with lanolin (part number DLN-13733). This saves wear and tear on the cartridge cases and your reloading equipment; you'll feel the significant reduction in force required to operate the press!

Although this conventional die set can be used universally, it is intended for non-progressive reloading machines.
This set includes three dies; a titanium carbide sizing die, expander die and bullet seating die with built-in crimp.

These dies can be used to load 32 Auto (ACP) ammunition and similar calibres, where applicable.

<p>Not as robustly constructed as the larger RL 550 or XL 650, the SDB is intended for &ldquo;occasional shooters&rdquo; who load fewer than ~500 rounds per month, or 6 000 rounds per year. The Square Deal B only loads popular handgun calibres, no rifle calibres!</p>
<p>For complete peace of mind, the SDB is covered by Dillon&rsquo;s legendary Lifetime ""No-B.S."" warranty.

<p>Depending on what calibre you are going to, and where you are changing from, y<span class=""s1"">ou may also need a different case feed plate for the electric case feeder. Please refer to the calibre conversion chart in the Instruction Manual for the correct plate.

</table>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"<p>This set of optional accessories for the RL 550B are very popular and we do feel they add a lot of value. We’ve grouped them to make the complex list a bit more understandable.</p>
<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire RL 550B above your bench top. It raises the height of the RL 550B by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge.</p>

<p>The tool head on the RL 550B is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are usually too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most other adjustments on your RL 550B require Allen wrenches. The RL 550B is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work “off axis”, a much more convenient solution!</p>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire RL 550B above your bench top. It raises the height of the RL 550B by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge.</p>

<p>Most other adjustments on your RL 550B require Allen wrenches. The RL 550B is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt.

We’ve grouped them to make the complex list a bit more understandable.</p>
<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire RL 550B above your bench top. It raises the height of the RL 550B by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge.</p>

Not as robustly constructed as the larger RL 550B or XL 650, the SDB is intended for “occasional shooters” who load fewer than ~500 rounds per month (6 000 rounds per year). The SDB is more prone to high levels of wear or even mechanical failure if these levels are frequently exceeded. While fully covered by Dillon’s warranty, any failure is frustrating so Shooting Stuff recommends large-volume shooters should rather consider a bigger, stronger Dillon progressive reloading machine like the RL 550B or XL 650.</p>
<p>For complete peace of mind, the SDB is covered by Dillon’s legendary Lifetime ""No-B.S."" warranty. All electrical & electronic components in Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty, as are textiles. Shooting Stuff fully supports Dillon’s warranty and has a spares cupboard with most spare parts available in stock. </p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine, the SDB works as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case (at the bottom).

<ul>
<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>
<li>It is personal preference / technique whether the empty cartridge case is inserted to Station 1 before or after the primer has been seated, but most operators insert the case after seating the primer, and then start the cycle by again pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>
<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>
<li>Firstly, only if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>
<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why large calibres load slower than small calibres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case and bullet enter the seating die where the bullet is seated to the desired depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>
<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>

<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>

DLNSDB-BUNDLE,shs_en,Reloading Machines,bundle,,,,"<p>The Dillon SDB is a 4-station progressive reloading machine capable of loading 400 to 500 rounds per hour. Not as robustly constructed as the larger RL 550B or XL 650, the SDB is intended for “occasional shooters” who load fewer than ~500 rounds per month (6 000 rounds per year). The SDB is more prone to high levels of wear or even mechanical failure if these levels are frequently exceeded. While fully covered by Dillon’s warranty, any failure is frustrating so Shooting Stuff recommends large-volume shooters should rather consider a bigger, stronger Dillon progressive reloading machine like the RL 550B or XL 650.</p>
<p>For complete peace of mind, the SDB is covered by Dillon’s legendary Lifetime ""No-B.S."" warranty. All electrical & electronic components in Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty, as are textiles. Shooting Stuff fully supports Dillon’s warranty and has a spares cupboard with most spare parts available in stock. </p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine, the SDB works as follows:</p>
<table border=""1"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The cartridge case is manually inserted into the shell plate (at the bottom).</li>
<li>When the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case enters the first die and is resized and de-primed (at the top).</li>
<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case (at the bottom).

<ul>
<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>
<li>It is personal preference / technique whether the empty cartridge case is inserted to Station 1 before or after the primer has been seated, but most operators insert the case after seating the primer, and then start the cycle by again pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>
<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>
<li>Firstly, only if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>
<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why large calibres load slower than small calibres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth (at the bottom).</li>
<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case and bullet enter the seating die where the bullet is seated to the desired depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Station 4</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>
<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>
<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>
<li>With progressive machines like the SDB, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<p>The tool head on the SDB is very compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are generally too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon SDB-dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work “off axis”, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the SDB spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire SDB above your bench top. It raises the height of the SDB by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge.</p>

<p>The tool head on the SDB is very compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are generally too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon SDB-dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work “off axis”, a much more convenient solution!</p>

DLNXL650-BUNDLE,,Reloading Machines,bundle,"Shooting Stuff/Reloading,Shooting Stuff/Reloading/Reloading Machines/Progressive",shs,Dillon XL 650 Progressive Reloading Kit,"<p>The XL 650 is Dillon's premier reloader, fully covered by their legendary Lifetime No-BS Warranty. It is designed to load most popular handgun calibres at 800 to 1 000 rounds per hour, and rifle calibres up to .30-06 Spr, .375 H&H;, etc. just a little slower.</p>
<p>The optional electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 4 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the XL 650 works as follows:</p>

<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Resize & Deprime / Prime</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>
<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>
<li>When the handle is lowered for the second time, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 1 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.

<ul>
<li>Like all the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the XL 650 happen “at the top” when the handle is lowered, and the platform with shell plate and cartridge cases is raised to the tool head that holds the dies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong><strong><strong>Powder Drop / Flare</strong></strong></strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case.

<ul>
<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>
<li>It is good practice to always start a cycle by pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>
<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>
<li>Firstly, <span>only</span> if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>
<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Powder Check</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>
<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>
<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>
<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<ul>
<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>
<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>
<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>
<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>
<li>With progressive machines like the XL 650, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge. The lower XL&nbsp;650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7&rdquo; (~175mm).</p>

<h3><b>Case Feed</b></h3>
<p>Dillon usually offers an automated way of doing things (at additional cost), or a less expensive manual way. The XL&nbsp;650 is supplied with a case feed tube that holds up to 15 empty cartridge cases. As the level drops during loading, additional cases must be periodically added. To get the most out of your XL&nbsp;650, we recommend the optional 220V electrical case feeder.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge. The lower XL&nbsp;650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7&rdquo; (~175mm).</p>

<p>The tool head on the XL 650 is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners may be too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your XL 650 require Allen wrenches. The XL 650 is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the 1-inch spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

DLNXL650-BUNDLE,shs_en,Reloading Machines,bundle,,,,"<p>The XL 650 is Dillon's premier reloader, fully covered by their legendary Lifetime No-BS Warranty. It is designed to load most popular handgun calibres at 800 to 1 000 rounds per hour, and rifle calibres up to .30-06 Spr, .375 H&H;, etc. just a little slower.</p>
<p>The optional electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 4 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the XL 650 works as follows:</p>
<table border=""1"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 180px;"">
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Resize & Deprime / Prime</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>
<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>
<li>When the handle is lowered for the second time, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 1 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.

<ul>
<li>Like all the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the XL 650 happen “at the top” when the handle is lowered, and the platform with shell plate and cartridge cases is raised to the tool head that holds the dies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong><strong><strong>Powder Drop / Flare</strong></strong></strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case.

<ul>
<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>
<li>It is good practice to always start a cycle by pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>
<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>
<li>Firstly, <span>only</span> if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>
<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Powder Check</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>
<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>
<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>
<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like the powder measure, the powder check system must be pre-set to the desired charge.</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, correctly-charged case to station 4.</li>
</ul>

Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the resized, primed & charged case and bullet enter the seating die, as the platform is raised. The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>
<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>5. Crimp</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>
<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>
<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>
<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>
<li>With progressive machines like the XL 650, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge. The lower XL 650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7” (~175mm).</p>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9” (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench’s front edge. The lower XL 650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7” (~175mm).</p>

<p>The tool head on the XL 650 is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners may be too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your XL 650 require Allen wrenches. The XL 650 is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work “off axis”, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the 1-inch spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

DLNS1050-BUNDLE,,Reloading Machines,bundle,"Shooting Stuff/Reloading,Shooting Stuff/Reloading/Reloading Machines/Progressive",shs,Dillon Super 1050 Progressive Reloading Kit,"<p>The Super 1050 is Dillon's commercial reloader, capable of loading ammo at 1 000 to 1 200 rounds per hour. Evolving from the original RL 1050 it now features a lengthened frame and new crank assembly. These modifications increased the stroke length to allow for longer rifle cartridges (up to .30-06), while maintaining minimum handle stroke for high production rates.</p>
<p>The included electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 7 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>
<p>The Super 1050 also swages the primer pocket of each round.  This process removes the crimp typically applied to military and law enforcement brass, reforming the primer pocket to the correct size and shape.</p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the Super 1050 works as follows:</p>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>
<li>The only action that occurs in station 1 is to insert the case into the shell plate, so one more cycle of the handle is required to advance the first case to station 2, and load a second case into station 1.</li>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, <span>only</span> if a case is present, the powder activator is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder activator (also known as the powder funnel) and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

Once adjusted for a specific charge the sensor’s brass-tipped probe enters each case and is pushed up by the propellant, to check the level of powder in the case. In the event of a significant error in powder charge, either too high or too low, the sensor sounds an audible alarm. This is a safety check, not an accuracy check, and while not absolutely essential we feel it’s valuable enough that we included it as essential!</p>

DLNS1050-BUNDLE,shs_en,Reloading Machines,bundle,,,,"<p>The Super 1050 is Dillon's commercial reloader, capable of loading ammo at 1 000 to 1 200 rounds per hour. Evolving from the original RL 1050 it now features a lengthened frame and new crank assembly. These modifications increased the stroke length to allow for longer rifle cartridges (up to .30-06), while maintaining minimum handle stroke for high production rates.</p>
<p>The included electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 7 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>
<p>The Super 1050 also swages the primer pocket of each round.  This process removes the crimp typically applied to military and law enforcement brass, reforming the primer pocket to the correct size and shape.</p>
<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the Super 1050 works as follows:</p>
<table border=""1"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>
<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>
<li>The only action that occurs in station 1 is to insert the case into the shell plate, so one more cycle of the handle is required to advance the first case to station 2, and load a second case into station 1.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>When the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 2 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.</li>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the Super 1050 happen “at the bottom” when the handle is lowered, and the tool head lowers onto the cases in the shell plate.</li>
</ul>
<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 3.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the resized and de-primed case enters the swaging die.</li>
<li>Two functions are performed on the resized and de-primed case in station 3:

<ul>
<li>The primer pocket is swaged when a hardened swage rod is forced into the empty primer pocket from underneath the case.

<ul>
<li>Swaging reforms the primer pocket, especially the mouth of the primer pocket, and is primarily intended to remove the three-point crimp or ring-crimp typically applied to American military ammunition.</li>
<li>The swage process does <span>not</span> convert Berdan primed cases (typical South Africa military ammunition) to reloadable Boxer format!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To support the web of the case from the inside during swaging, a backup / expander rod is inserted through the case mouth.

<ul>
<li>The backup / expander rod supports the web of the case (where the flash hole is), pushing down against the swage rod.</li>
<li>At the same time the case mouth is also expanded by a wider portion of the backup / expander rod to be ready to accept the correct sized bullet (later in station 7).</li>

<ul>
<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge.</li>
<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder activator up. The powder activator serves two purposes:

<ul>
<li>Firstly, <span>only</span> if a case is present, the powder activator is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>
<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder activator (also known as the powder funnel) and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>
<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, pistol cases are not flared / belled here in the powder measure station – this happens in station 3 on the Super 1050.</li>
<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 6.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Station 6</strong></td>

<ul>

<ul>

<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>
<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>
<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, raising the tool head and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>
