<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li></ol>

This third generation handgun holds 13 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>

<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>

<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>

<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>

<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>

<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>

<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li></ol>

<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>

This fourth generation handgun holds 13 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available. This model is designed specifically to comply with IPSC Standard Gun size limitations. The MOS-models are designed to accept ruggedised Miniature Optical Sights, mounted to the slide.</p>

<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>

<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>

<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>

<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>

<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>

<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li></ol>

<li>The Tri-Glide trigger system reduces contact points and friction, leading to the most sought-after trigger system for 1911 pistols! The interchangeable trigger inserts allow the trigger reach to be adjusted, as well as the ""feel"" - curved, flat and combinations are available.</li>

It is offered in two fundamental variants, for IPSC Standard Gun division and for IPSC Open Gun division.</p><p>Based on the proven CZ 75 heritage, the TS is bigger with a full dust cover (the frame ahead of the trigger guard), and differs from the original CZ 75 in having only a single action trigger mechanism. The match trigger is adjustable.</p><p>The magazine catch is extended for easier operation and the bottom of the grip includes an integral magazine well for easier and quicker reloads.</p><p>The CZ 75 TS-9 Orange has a 1.5mm red fibre-optic front sight, plain black Novak-style rear sight. This competition pistol features an ergonomic manual safety catch, but is without a firing pin safety for an improved trigger pull. 

This distinctive Orange model has bright orange anodised aluminium grip panels, as well as matching magazine base pads.

The Orange offers enhanced accuracy through the hand fitted, polished barrel mated to a precisely fitted slide with minimum lateral tolerances. The improved single-action trigger mechanism with re-designed hammer further enhances delivered precision.</p>","The CZ 75 TS (Tactical Sport) 9x19 Competition Pistol (Orange) is a modern competition firearm with a traditional steel frame, chambered for 9mm Luger calibre ammunition.

"BFS-GLK-G17-4",,"Firearms","simple","root/Promotions/Black Friday","shs","Glock G17 Gen 4 9x19 Standard Pistol","<p>The Glock G17 Gen 4 9x19 Standard Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition. This fourth generation handgun holds 17 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>

<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>

<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>

<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>

<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>

<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>

<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The drop safety prevents the trigger mechanism from ""activating"" and firing an unintentional shot in the event that the pistol drops or falls onto a hard surface. Only with sufficient rearward travel of the trigger can the firing pin be released, firing the shot. </li></ol>

<p>The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator, and the trigger offers further visual and tactile cues to the gun's status.</p>

<p>Standard models are well suited to open carry by law enforcement officers, and remain popular with competition shooters and larger framed people for concealed carry.</p>","The Glock G17 Gen 4 9x19 Standard Pistol is a modern firearm with a lightweight polymer frame, chambered for 9mm Luger (9mm P, 9 x 19mm) calibre ammunition.

This fourth generation handgun holds 15 + 1 cartridges using the standard magazine; higher capacity magazines are available.</p>

<p>Glock Safe-Action pistols were introduced in the 1980's and have excelled in military, police and civilian environments. The Glock was the first commercially successful polymer framed handgun. Initially offered in 9x19mm Glock pistols are now available in many other calibres too.</p>

<p>With several different sizes available, there is a Glock to suit almost any requirement. Long-slide models are great for competition, standard models are well suited for officers on duty, for example, and the compact, sub-compact or slimline models offer a balanced, self-defence capability. Their versatility ensures that most models are multi-functional, serving well for home defence, daily carry, duty or competition!</p>

<p>The polymer frame and grip is tough, lightweight and corrosion resistant. Tenifer, the 'nearly hard as diamond' Glock surface treatment, protects the barrel and slide while remaining anti-reflective.</p>

<p>Shooting Stuff recommends Glock pistols! With minimal external controls they are extremely easy to use and to learn to use, for left-handed and right-handed shooters! They are reliable, durable and lightweight. Three independent, automatic safety features ensure that the pistol fires when, and only when, the trigger is deliberately pulled. All three safety features re-engage when the trigger is released, automatically securing the pistol again. We believe that Glock is the best supported firearms brand in South Africa, with spares, magazines, holsters and many aftermarket accessories available ex-stock.</p>

<p><strong>Three automatic safety features:</strong></p>

<ol><li>The trigger safety prevents inadvertent firing by lateral force on the trigger, and is automatically depressed when initial tension is applied to the trigger. It automatically resets when the trigger is released.</p>

</li><li>The firing pin safety is a hardened steel plunger that blocks the firing pin from igniting the chambered cartridge until the trigger is pulled to the rear, pushing  the firing pin safety up and out of the way. It automatically reactivates when the trigger is released.</p>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>

It raises the height of the RL&nbsp;550B by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge.</p>

The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt.

<p>The RL&nbsp;550B is covered by Dillon&rsquo;s legendary Lifetime 'No-B.S' warranty. Shooting Stuff fully supports this warranty and has a spares cupboard with most spare parts available in stock. Please note that electric / electronic items and textiles have a 1-year warranty.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"recommended_accesories=<p>This set of optional accessories for the RL 550B are very popular and we do feel they add a lot of value. We&rsquo;ve grouped them to make the complex list a bit more understandable.</p>
<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire RL&nbsp;550B above your bench top. It raises the height of the RL&nbsp;550B by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge.</p>

<p>The tool head on the RL 550B is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are usually too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most other adjustments on your RL 550B require Allen wrenches. The RL 550B is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>

"DLNSDB-BUNDLE",,"Reloading Machines","bundle","root/Reloading,root/Reloading/Reloading Machines/Progressive","shs","Dillon Square Deal B Progressive Reloading Kit","<p>The Dillon SDB is a 4-station progressive reloading machine capable of loading 400 to 500 rounds per hour. Not as robustly constructed as the larger RL 550B or XL 650, the SDB is intended for &ldquo;occasional shooters&rdquo; who load fewer than ~500 rounds per month (6 000 rounds per year). The SDB is more prone to high levels of wear or even mechanical failure if these levels are frequently exceeded. While fully covered by Dillon&rsquo;s warranty, any failure is frustrating so Shooting Stuff recommends large-volume shooters should rather consider a bigger, stronger Dillon progressive reloading machine like the RL 550B or XL 650.</p>

<p>For complete peace of mind, the SDB is covered by Dillon&rsquo;s legendary Lifetime ""No-B.S."" warranty. All electrical & electronic components in Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty, as are textiles. Shooting Stuff fully supports Dillon&rsquo;s warranty and has a spares cupboard with most spare parts available in stock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine, the SDB works as follows:</p>

<table style=""width: 868px; height: 82px;"" border=""1"">

<tr>

<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The cartridge case is manually inserted into the shell plate (at the bottom).</li>

<li>When the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case enters the first die and is resized and de-primed (at the top).</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case (at the bottom).

<ul>

<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>

<li>It is personal preference / technique whether the empty cartridge case is inserted to Station 1 before or after the primer has been seated, but most operators insert the case after seating the primer, and then start the cycle by again pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;only&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why large calibres load slower than small calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth (at the bottom).</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case and bullet enter the seating die where the bullet is seated to the desired depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 4</strong></td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the SDB, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<p>The tool head on the SDB is very compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are generally too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon SDB-dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the SDB spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

"DLNSDB-BUNDLE","shs_en","Reloading Machines","bundle",,,,"<p>The Dillon SDB is a 4-station progressive reloading machine capable of loading 400 to 500 rounds per hour. Not as robustly constructed as the larger RL 550B or XL 650, the SDB is intended for &ldquo;occasional shooters&rdquo; who load fewer than ~500 rounds per month (6 000 rounds per year). The SDB is more prone to high levels of wear or even mechanical failure if these levels are frequently exceeded. While fully covered by Dillon&rsquo;s warranty, any failure is frustrating so Shooting Stuff recommends large-volume shooters should rather consider a bigger, stronger Dillon progressive reloading machine like the RL 550B or XL 650.</p>

<p>For complete peace of mind, the SDB is covered by Dillon&rsquo;s legendary Lifetime ""No-B.S."" warranty. All electrical & electronic components in Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty, as are textiles. Shooting Stuff fully supports Dillon&rsquo;s warranty and has a spares cupboard with most spare parts available in stock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine, the SDB works as follows:</p>

<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The cartridge case is manually inserted into the shell plate (at the bottom).</li>

<li>When the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case enters the first die and is resized and de-primed (at the top).</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case (at the bottom).

<ul>

<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>

<li>It is personal preference / technique whether the empty cartridge case is inserted to Station 1 before or after the primer has been seated, but most operators insert the case after seating the primer, and then start the cycle by again pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;only&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why large calibres load slower than small calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth (at the bottom).</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the platform and shell plate to the dies in the tool head, the case and bullet enter the seating die where the bullet is seated to the desired depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 4</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the SDB, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<p>The tool head on the SDB is very compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners are generally too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon SDB-dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your SDB require Allen wrenches. The SDB is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the SDB spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>
<p>Convenient toolkits with mounting brackets are available (all the tools required to adjust and basically service the SDB machine):&nbsp;</p>

"DLNXL650-BUNDLE",,"Reloading Machines","bundle","root/Reloading,root/Reloading/Reloading Machines/Progressive","shs","Dillon XL 650 Progressive Reloading Kit","<p>The XL 650 is Dillon's premier reloader, fully covered by their legendary Lifetime No-BS Warranty. It is designed to load most popular handgun calibres at 800 to 1 000 rounds per hour, and rifle calibres up to .30-06 Spr, .375 H&H, etc. just a little slower.</p>

<p>The optional electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 4 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the XL 650 works as follows:</p>

<table style=""width: 868px; height: 82px;"" border=""1"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td style=""width: 180px;"">

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Resize & Deprime / Prime</strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>When the handle is lowered for the second time, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 1 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.

<ul>

<li>Like all the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the XL 650 happen &ldquo;at the top&rdquo; when the handle is lowered, and the platform with shell plate and cartridge cases is raised to the tool head that holds the dies.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><strong>Powder Drop / Flare</strong></strong></strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case.

<ul>

<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>

<li>It is good practice to always start a cycle by pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;<span>only</span>&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Powder Check</strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>

<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>

<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Like the powder measure, the powder check system must be pre-set to the desired charge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, correctly-charged case to station 4.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>4. Seat</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the resized, primed & charged case and bullet enter the seating die, as the platform is raised. The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>5. Crimp</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the XL 650, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

</ul>

</table>,recommended_accesories=<p>These optional accessories for the XL 650 are very popular and we do feel they add a lot of value. We&rsquo;ve grouped them to make the complex list a bit more understandable.</p>
<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge. The lower XL&nbsp;650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7&rdquo; (~175mm).</p>

<h3><b>Case Feed</b></h3>
<p>Dillon usually offers an automated way of doing things (at additional cost), or a less expensive manual way. The XL&nbsp;650 is supplied with a case feed tube that holds up to 15 empty cartridge cases. As the level drops during loading, additional cases must be periodically added. To get the most out of your XL&nbsp;650, we recommend the optional 220V electrical case feeder.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Primer Transfer</b></h3>
<p>Dillon offers a manual system of flip tray and pick-up tubes or an automated system to get the primers from their shipping box into the XL 650 primer magazine. While the manual approach is most popular approach, the RF&nbsp;100 is really convenient!</p>

<p>The tool head on the XL 650 is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners may be too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your XL 650 require Allen wrenches. The XL 650 is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the 1-inch spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

"DLNXL650-BUNDLE","shs_en","Reloading Machines","bundle",,,,"<p>The XL 650 is Dillon's premier reloader, fully covered by their legendary Lifetime No-BS Warranty. It is designed to load most popular handgun calibres at 800 to 1 000 rounds per hour, and rifle calibres up to .30-06 Spr, .375 H&H, etc. just a little slower.</p>

<p>The optional electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 4 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the XL 650 works as follows:</p>

<table style=""width: 868px; height: 82px;"" border=""1"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td style=""width: 180px;"">

<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Resize & Deprime / Prime</strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>When the handle is lowered for the second time, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 1 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.

<ul>

<li>Like all the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the XL 650 happen &ldquo;at the top&rdquo; when the handle is lowered, and the platform with shell plate and cartridge cases is raised to the tool head that holds the dies.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 2.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong><strong>Powder Drop / Flare</strong></strong></strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>At the end of each cycle, or the start of the next, the handle is pushed away from the operator to insert / seat a new primer into the empty, resized and de-primed case.

<ul>

<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized cartridge case.</li>

<li>It is good practice to always start a cycle by pushing the handle away to seat the primer, or confirm that the primer is seated.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered again, raising the cartridge case(s) in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge and the case mouth is flared / belled to facilitate later bullet seating.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder funnel up. The powder funnel serves several purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;<span>only</span>&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder funnel is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder funnel and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Pistol cases are flared / belled in the powder measure station to facilitate seating of the bullet, and especially lead bullets. This action is less critical for copper plated or jacketed bevel-based bullets.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 3.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Powder Check</strong></p>

</td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>

<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>

<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Like the powder measure, the powder check system must be pre-set to the desired charge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, correctly-charged case to station 4.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>4. Seat</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the resized, primed & charged case and bullet enter the seating die, as the platform is raised. The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, lowering the platform and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>5. Crimp</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as always, first push the handle away to seat the primer into the case in station 2. Then, as the handle is lowered, raising the cartridge cases in the shell plate to the tool head with dies, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 2 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, lowering the platform and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the XL 650, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<h3><b>Machine Mounting</b></h3>
<p>If your bench is either too low for comfortable use, or you need to access drawers underneath, a Machine Mount or Strong Mount elevates the entire XL 650 above your bench top. The RL550/XL650 versions raise the height of the XL 650 by about 9&rdquo; (~220mm) and moves the entire machine back slightly so that less protrudes in front of the bench&rsquo;s front edge. The lower XL&nbsp;650-only mounts raise the height of the XL 650 by about 7&rdquo; (~175mm).</p>

<p>The tool head on the XL 650 is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners may be too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.</p>
<p>Most adjustments on your XL 650 require Allen wrenches. The XL 650 is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the 1-inch spanner. The bracket mounts to the back of the machine.</p>

"DLNS1050-BUNDLE",,"Reloading Machines","bundle","root/Reloading,root/Reloading/Reloading Machines/Progressive","shs","Dillon Super 1050 Progressive Reloading Kit","<p>The Super 1050 is Dillon's commercial reloader, capable of loading ammo at 1&nbsp;000 to 1 200 rounds per hour. Evolving from the original RL 1050 it now features a lengthened frame and new crank assembly. These modifications increased the stroke length to allow for longer rifle cartridges (up to .30-06), while maintaining minimum handle stroke for high production rates.</p>

<p>The included electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 7 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>

<p>The Super 1050 also swages the primer pocket of each round.&nbsp; This process removes the crimp typically applied to military and law enforcement brass, reforming the primer pocket to the correct size and shape.</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the Super 1050 works as follows:</p>

<table style=""height: 82px;"" border=""1"">

<tbody>

<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>The only action that occurs in station 1 is to insert the case into the shell plate, so one more cycle of the handle is required to advance the first case to station 2, and load a second case into station 1.</li>

</ul>

</td>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>When the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 2 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.</li>

<ul>

<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the Super 1050 happen &ldquo;at the bottom&rdquo; when the handle is lowered, and the tool head lowers onto the cases in the shell plate.</li>

<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the resized and de-primed case enters the swaging die.</li>

<li>Two functions are performed on the resized and de-primed case in station 3:

<ul>

<li>The primer pocket is swaged when a hardened swage rod is forced into the empty primer pocket from underneath the case.

<ul>

<li>Swaging reforms the primer pocket, especially the mouth of the primer pocket, and is primarily intended to remove the three-point crimp or ring-crimp typically applied to American military ammunition.</li>

<li>The swage process does&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;convert Berdan primed cases (typical South Africa military ammunition) to reloadable Boxer format!</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>To support the web of the case from the inside during swaging, a backup / expander rod is inserted through the case mouth.

<ul>

<li>The backup / expander rod supports the web of the case (where the flash hole is), pushing down against the swage rod.</li>

<li>At the same time the case mouth is also expanded by a wider portion of the backup / expander rod to be ready to accept the correct sized bullet (later in station 7).</li>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 5</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder activator up. The powder activator serves two purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;<span>only</span>&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder activator is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder activator (also known as the powder funnel) and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, pistol cases are not flared / belled here in the powder measure station &ndash; this happens in station 3 on the Super 1050.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 6.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 6</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>

<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>

<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Like the powder measure, the powder check system must be pre-set to the desired charge.</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the resized, primed & charged case and bullet enter the seating die, as the die is lowered. The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 8</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 3 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, raising the tool head and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the Super 1050, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

<td>The tool head on the Super 1050 is quite compact, with little space between dies. Conventional spanners or shifting spanners may be too bulky to work well in the confined space, so we offer a specially designed spanner to get in and adjust then lock your Dillon dies.&nbsp;<br />
<p>Other than the 15/16&rdquo; tool head bolt, most other adjustments on your Super 1050 require Allen wrenches. The Super 1050 is supplied with a standard set of these, adequate to work on your machine. The development of ball-ended Allen wrenches made it much easier to adjust bolts and screws where space constraints make it difficult to perfectly align the standard Allen wrench with the bolt. The ball-end allows you to work &ldquo;off axis&rdquo;, a much more convenient solution!</p>
<p>We have developed a stylish toolkit bracket to conveniently hold a set of ball-ended Allen wrenches as well as the 1-inch spanner. The bracket mounts to the left of the machine.</p>
<p>Convenient toolkits with mounting brackets are available (all the tools required to adjust and basically service the Super 1050 machine):</p>

"DLNS1050-BUNDLE","shs_en","Reloading Machines","bundle",,,,"<p>The Super 1050 is Dillon's commercial reloader, capable of loading ammo at 1&nbsp;000 to 1 200 rounds per hour. Evolving from the original RL 1050 it now features a lengthened frame and new crank assembly. These modifications increased the stroke length to allow for longer rifle cartridges (up to .30-06), while maintaining minimum handle stroke for high production rates.</p>

<p>The included electrically powered case feeder automatically and reliably feeds the cases right-way-up into the shell plate. Just pour your lubricated, clean cartridge cases into the blue case feed hopper and the device sorts them and feeds them right-way-up into the case feed tube that takes the cartridge cases to the first station of the shell plate. Once the shell plate is fully charged, a loaded cartridge is ejected every time the handle is pulled. Manually place a bullet on the prepared cartridge case in station 7 and pull the handle; all other actions happen automatically.</p>

<p>The Super 1050 also swages the primer pocket of each round.&nbsp; This process removes the crimp typically applied to military and law enforcement brass, reforming the primer pocket to the correct size and shape.</p>

<p>Starting with an empty machine but filled case feeder tube, the Super 1050 works as follows:</p>

<table style=""height: 82px;"" border=""1"">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td style=""width: 200px;""><strong>Station 1</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>The case insert mechanism is retracted as the handle is lowered and then inserts each cleaned and lubricated cartridge case automatically into the shell plate when the handle is raised each time.</li>

<li>The handle is operated using the right hand.</li>

<li>The only action that occurs in station 1 is to insert the case into the shell plate, so one more cycle of the handle is required to advance the first case to station 2, and load a second case into station 1.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 2</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>When the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the cleaned, lubricated, used case in station 2 enters the first die and is resized and de-primed.</li>

<ul>

<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, all loading actions on the Super 1050 happen &ldquo;at the bottom&rdquo; when the handle is lowered, and the tool head lowers onto the cases in the shell plate.</li>

</ul>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the resized and de-primed case to station 3.</li>

</ul>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 3</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the resized and de-primed case enters the swaging die.</li>

<li>Two functions are performed on the resized and de-primed case in station 3:

<ul>

<li>The primer pocket is swaged when a hardened swage rod is forced into the empty primer pocket from underneath the case.

<ul>

<li>Swaging reforms the primer pocket, especially the mouth of the primer pocket, and is primarily intended to remove the three-point crimp or ring-crimp typically applied to American military ammunition.</li>

<li>The swage process does&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;convert Berdan primed cases (typical South Africa military ammunition) to reloadable Boxer format!</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>To support the web of the case from the inside during swaging, a backup / expander rod is inserted through the case mouth.

<ul>

<li>The backup / expander rod supports the web of the case (where the flash hole is), pushing down against the swage rod.</li>

<li>At the same time the case mouth is also expanded by a wider portion of the backup / expander rod to be ready to accept the correct sized bullet (later in station 7).</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>The primer is automatically fed from the reinforced primer magazine to the correct position under the resized and swaged cartridge case.</li>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 5</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the newly primed cartridge case receives the correct powder charge.</li>

<li>The case enters the powder die and the case mouth pushes the powder activator up. The powder activator serves two purposes:

<ul>

<li>Firstly,&nbsp;<span>only</span>&nbsp;if a case is present, the powder activator is forced up into the powder die, activating / cycling the powder measure to dispense the previously-calibrated charge of propellant. No case = no mess!</li>

<li>Secondly, the powder charge falls through the hollow powder activator (also known as the powder funnel) and is guided into the case without mess.

<ul>

<li>It does take time for a large powder charge to fall through, so pause for a second or two when your load requires large quantities of propellant, especially extruded types. This is why rifle cartridges load slower than pistol calibres.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Unlike the smaller Dillon machines, pistol cases are not flared / belled here in the powder measure station &ndash; this happens in station 3 on the Super 1050.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, charged case to station 6.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 6</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>This station requires the optional powder check system, a valuable safety feature that we highly recommend to verify that the powder charge is at a safe level.</li>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, a powder check probe enters the case mouth and rests on the propellant in the case.

<ul>

<li>The level of propellant / powder in the case pushes the probe up.</li>

<li>Should the level of propellant in the case be out of safe limits (too high or too low) an alarm is sounded to alert the operator to take remedial action.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Like the powder measure, the powder check system must be pre-set to the desired charge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the primed, correctly-charged case to station 7.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 7</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>Using the left hand, a bullet is manually positioned in the case mouth.</li>

<li>As the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the resized, primed & charged case and bullet enter the seating die, as the die is lowered. The bullet is pushed into the case and seated to the desired, pre-set depth to achieve a suitable overall length of the cartridge.</li>

<li>The handle is raised, raising the tool head and the shell plate is automatically indexed to end the cycle, moving the cartridge to the final station.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><strong>Station 8</strong></td>

<td>

<ul>

<li>On the next cycle, as the handle is lowered, lowering the tool head with dies to the cartridge cases in the shell plate, the case with seated bullet enters the final die. A taper crimp is applied to remove the flare that was applied at station 3 (on pistol calibres) and to suitably grip the bullet.</li>

<li>The crimp is especially important for semi-automatic firearms to ensure safe and reliable feeding from the magazine into the chamber.

<ul>

<li>All Dillon dies feature separate seating and crimping.</li>

<li>Other brand dies may not apply crimp, and this is generally the norm for bolt-action rifles.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The cartridge is automatically ejected into the cartridge bin when the handle is raised, raising the tool head and automatically indexing the shell plate to end the cycle.

<ul>

<li>With progressive machines like the Super 1050, all of the functions are being simultaneously performed each and every cycle, so a loaded cartridge is ejected each time the handle is cycled.</li>

</ul>
